# Installation
All code is written in Python. In order to run the code, the following packages must be installed:

* numpy 
* matplotlib

Installing these packages can be done using:
```sh
$ pip install <packagename>
```

# Running the example
Run the demo script to run a particle filter for robot localization in the simulated world.

In Windows:
```sh
$ python3.7.exe .\demo_running_example.py
```

In Linux:
```sh
$ python3 demo_running_example.py
```

The simulation will run and the visualization shows the simulated world with the landmarks, the real robot position and orientation and the particles of the particle filter.
